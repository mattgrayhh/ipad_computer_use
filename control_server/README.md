# Control server

Routes ordered actions and screenshot requests to one permitted iPad session.

This fork also provides the optional [`jev_decide` MCP tool](jev/README.md) for
local OCR and TypeSafe Jev action proposals. It uses the existing calibration and
input pipeline and returns control to the calling agent for execution or visual
reasoning.
The iPad maintains an outbound WebSocket; requests complete only after its reply.
The server requires no USB access or Apple SDK. Node.js 20+ is required.

## Start

From the repository root, run `npm ci`, then:

```sh
npm run start:background --workspace control_server
npm run calibration:background --workspace control_server
npm run mcp:background --workspace control_server
```

For foreground service managers use `npm start --workspace control_server` and
`npm run calibration --workspace control_server` and
`npm run mcp --workspace control_server` as managed processes.
Logs, PIDs, captured frames, and calibration profiles live in
`.state/` inside this component. `CONTROL_SERVER_STATE_DIR` overrides that path;
both processes must use the same directory and configuration.
The input-device secret also lives there by default and is embedded into the
firmware by `input_device/scripts/build.sh`.

| Environment | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `PORT` | `8765` |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` |
| `CALIBRATION_PORT` | `8766` |
| `MCP_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` |
| `MCP_PORT` | `8780` |
| `CONTROL_SERVER_STATE_DIR` | Component-local `.state/` |
| `INPUT_DEVICE_SECRET` | Generated in `.state/input_device_secret` |

The server is **single-device**, not general multi-client pub-sub. New clients
cannot displace an active device. Session permits are single-use and expire if
not claimed within two minutes. Server restart invalidates every session.

## Computer-use client

Run these on the server host after starting a session in the iPad app:

```sh
node control_server/client.js status
node control_server/client.js screen
node control_server/client.js send 'hello{ENTER}'
node control_server/client.js move 20 -10
node control_server/client.js click
node control_server/client.js scroll 3
node control_server/client.js actions control_server/examples/input_actions.json
node control_server/client.js computer_use control_server/examples/computer_use_actions.json
node control_server/client.js stop
```

`stop` cancels the current command; **End Session** in the app revokes the whole
session. Text goes to the focused app. Mouse movement is relative HID counts.
Screenshots are independent of actions and return a fresh captured frame.

The controller API is loopback-only and rejects browser origins. App-facing
routes have no app-layer password, so run them only on a trusted network or
behind a private transport such as Tailscale. [Wire protocol](PROTOCOL.md)

## Boundaries

- `server.js`, `sessions.js`: device connection, session permits, command/screen routing.
- `config.js`: shared private state directory and input-device secret management.
- `calibration/`: native-surface telemetry, calibration worker, validated profiles.
- `client.js`: CLI adapter for the HTTP computer-use API.
- `test/`: protocol-level tests using simulated clients and optional Swift harness.
- `ipad_input_device`: declared dependency supplying the low-level codec. No imports into another component's private source paths.

The server has two action layers. `POST /computer-use/actions` is the intended
MCP/agent-facing shape: type text, press key chords, and use screenshot-oriented
coordinates. The server compiles those actions into the input records that the
iPad forwards to the attached tool.

## MCP adapter

The no-auth MCP adapter listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8780/mcp` by default and
is intended for a private local transport such as OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel. Keep
it loopback-only for public networks; only bind it to a Tailscale address when
the tailnet ACLs are the authentication boundary. The adapter exposes:

- `status`: reads connection/session/calibration state.
- `get_screen`: returns a fresh JPEG screenshot from the active broadcast.
- `issue_actions`: forwards high-level keyboard and pointer actions to
  `/computer-use/actions`.

Start it with:

```sh
npm run mcp:background --workspace control_server
```

Then point the tunnel client at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8780/mcp
```

For a Tailscale-native driver that can reach the host directly, run the same MCP
service on the tailnet IP instead:

```sh
MCP_HOST=100.x.y.z MCP_ALLOW_TAILNET=1 npm run mcp --workspace control_server
```

Use this MCP URL:

```text
http://100.x.y.z:8780/mcp
```

Do not publish that listener with Tailscale Funnel or a public reverse proxy.
There is no OAuth or bearer token in this mode; the private network is the
security boundary.

The MCP adapter calls the loopback controller API directly. It does not access
RP2040 hardware or iOS APIs directly. Absolute-looking
actions such as `move_to` and coordinate `click` are available through
`issue_actions`, but they need a known pointer origin. Calibration maps relative
HID counts to screen movement; it does not let the server observe the current
pointer location in arbitrary apps.

### MCP action shapes

The tool is deliberately strict so agents do not guess. `issue_actions` takes
one top-level object with an `actions` array. Key chords use a `press` action
whose `keys` value is an object, never an array:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {"type": "press", "keys": {"key": "space", "modifiers": ["cmd"]}},
    {"type": "type_text", "text": "notes"},
    {"type": "press", "keys": {"key": "enter"}}
  ]
}
```

Pointer actions use screenshot coordinates from the latest `get_screen` result.
Include both `coordinateSpace` and the observed current `pointer` position when
sending absolute coordinates. The pointer below is an example; use the actual
position visible on your screenshot, not a guessed center:

```json
{
  "coordinateSpace": {"width": 1280, "height": 960},
  "pointer": {"x": 400, "y": 300},
  "actions": [
    {"type": "move_to", "x": 640, "y": 480},
    {"type": "click", "x": 640, "y": 480},
    {"type": "scroll", "dy": 80},
    {"type": "wait", "ms": 500}
  ]
}
```

`scroll.dy` is signed USB wheel units, not pixels or a target coordinate.
On the tested iPad, **positive scrolls down and negative scrolls up**. Settings
can reverse the direction. Small values such as 3 may barely move the content.
Move over the intended scrollable pane, try 80, wait for the animation, and call
`get_screen` separately to verify movement. At a boundary, repeating the same
sign will not help; check the opposite sign and the hovered pane. A `completed`
response confirms input execution, not that the app visibly scrolled.

Physical-device verification through MCP confirmed a batch of five `dy: 127`
reports moved a LinkedIn feed to later posts, and five `dy: -127` reports
returned to the starting content. Scroll distance is app-dependent; this is a
diagnostic observation, not a promise of a fixed pixel displacement.

Valid action names are `type_text`, `press`, `move_to`, `move_by`, `click`,
`mouse_down`, `mouse_up`, `drag`, `scroll`, and `wait`. Common invalid shapes
are rejected on purpose:

```json
{"type": "press", "keys": ["cmd", "space"]}
{"type": "press", "key": "space", "modifiers": ["cmd"]}
{"type": "drag_to", "x": 100, "y": 100}
```

## Hosting

Optional background Live Activity updates use APNs. See
[Live Activity push setup](LIVE_ACTIVITY.md) for paid-team signing, credentials,
and device verification. Push delivery never gates computer-use commands.

The server can run on a VPS, but raw ports are not public-internet endpoints.
Use a private network or authenticated tunnel and route `/device`,
`/device-status/`, `/session/start`, and `/session/end` to 8765, and `/native`
to 8766. Keep controller and calibration administration routes private. A
controller running elsewhere needs a protected transport to the server host;
none is bundled yet. Read [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) before deploying.

Preserve `/native` when proxying calibration. With Tailscale Serve, keep the
control server and calibration service as separate upstreams:

```sh
tailscale serve --bg --https=443 --set-path=/ http://127.0.0.1:8765
tailscale serve --bg --https=443 --set-path=/native http://127.0.0.1:8766
```

This route is private to the tailnet; do not use Funnel to publish these
unauthenticated services.

The catch-all control route does not serve MCP. MCP is a separate service on
8780 and should either stay loopback-only for Secure MCP Tunnel or bind directly
to the tailnet IP with `MCP_ALLOW_TAILNET=1`. Test `/mcp` with a JSON-RPC
`initialize` POST, not a browser GET (which intentionally returns HTTP 405).
Tailscale clients must be on the permitted tailnet; external cloud clients need
a separately authenticated tunnel.

Test with `npm test --workspace control_server`. The Swift integration test is
run from `ipad_app/scripts/test_relay.sh` and is skipped in the Node-only suite.
